# Electron Calculator <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alex313031/electron-calculator-app/master/logo.png" width="64">

This is a simple Calculator app based on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).

## Running

Make sure that [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases) >=10.24.1 is installed on the system.

To run the application, simply checkout the code locally, then navigate inside the application's folder and run:

<code>npm install && npm run start</code>

This will download and install Electron [v22.3.5](https://releases.electronjs.org/releases/stable?version=22) in `node_modules` and then launch the application.

You can run
<code>npm run clean</code>
to clean out node_modules and start fresh.

## About

It is a port of [calculator.apps.chrome](https://calculator.apps.chrome), which is itself a web port of the original calculator app for ChromiumOS, which can be found [Here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/calculator/joodangkbfjnajiiifokapkpmhfnpleo). \
I have also made a fork of that app, which can be found [Here](https://github.com/Alex313031/CrOS-Calc).
