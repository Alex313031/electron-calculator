# Electron Calculator

This is a simple Calculator app based on Electron.

It is a port of https://calculator.apps.chrome, which is itself a web port of the original calculator app for ChromiumOS, which can be found at 
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/calculator/joodangkbfjnajiiifokapkpmhfnpleo. 
I have also made a fork of that app, which can be found at https://github.com/Alex313031/CrOS-Calc
